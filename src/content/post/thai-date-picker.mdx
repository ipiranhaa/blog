## Background

In my quest for a React UI library or framework compatible with the Buddhist year specified date picker, I scoured through popular options like [react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker), [react-date-picker](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-date-picker), [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app), [Ant Design](https://ant.design), and [MUI](https://mui.com). However, none seemed to offer native support.

Just when hope seemed dim, I stumbled upon the [date-fns-be](https://github.com/tarzui/date-fns-be) adaptor tailored for MUI. Although initially promising, it failed to function as expected. Nevertheless, it sparked the ingenious idea of crafting a Buddhist date-fns adaptor to seamlessly integrate with MUI.

Thus, the journey began to create the missing link the [date-fns-buddhist-adapter](https://github.com/ascendcorp/date-fns-buddhist-adapter). With this essential piece in place, the elusive Thai date picker finally came to fruition.

## Get Started

First, you need to install the dependencies

```shell
  pnpm add @mui/x-date-pickers date-fns date-fns-buddhist-adapter
```

Second, implement the code

```typescript
import { LocalizationProvider, MobileDatePicker } from '@mui/x-date-pickers'
import AdapterDateFns from 'date-fns-buddhist-adapter'
import { th } from 'date-fns/locale'
import { useState } from 'react'

export default function Home() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(new Date())

  return (
    <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns} adapterLocale={th}>
      <MobileDatePicker
        format="dd MMM yyyy"
        defaultValue={value}
        disablePast
        onChange={(newValue: Date | null) => {
          if (!newValue) return
          setValue(newValue)
        }}
      />
    </LocalizationProvider>
  )
}
```

And then you have the MUI Thai date picker! **Enjoy** ðŸŽ‰
